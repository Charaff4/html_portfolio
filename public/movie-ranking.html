 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <p><h3>Lord of the rings two towers</h3>
 I love fantasy movies, this part was my favorite of all of the other lord of the rings.
</p>
 <br />
 <p><h3>Monty python and the holy grail</h3>
It's a very funny depiction of the story of king Artur, even today the films humor still stands strong.
 </p>
 <br />
 <p><h3> Monty python Life of Brian</h3>
It's a bit less funny and inportant as the holy grail, but Life of Brain is a solid movie.
